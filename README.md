Useful little scripts that I use a lot

** ads_importer.py: This script grabs all the bibliographic info from ads and puts it into a latex bibliography file.
Reference all your citeations (\citet etc.) as the ads bibcode and it will match by that.
Usage: ads_importer.py latexfile
oputputs the file you input to bibliography{}. Note that the latexfile input has no extension!!
